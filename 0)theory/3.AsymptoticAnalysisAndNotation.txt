****************Asymptotic Analysis************

=>find which datastructure is best to resolve the problem
=>in which we use Asymptotic notation
=>by which space and time complexity


Asymptotic Notation:-
1)bigONoatation
2)Theta Notation
3)Omeaga Notation

time complexity depend on input

=>suppose have 10 input
n=10

f(n) = 5n*n + 6n +12
n*n = double loop me 5 line rahinge
n = single loop me 6 line rahinge
12 = line rahinge

f(10)= 5*10*10+6+12=572 complexity
 actual complexity is 500 else we remove
